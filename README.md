## Swift Package Registry

The [Swift Package Registry](https://swiftpackageregistry.com/) is a collection of Swift Packages. Since the [GitHub Swift Package Registry](https://github.blog/2019-06-03-github-package-registry-will-support-swift-packages/) is not currently released, the [Swift Package Registry](https://swiftpackageregistry.com/) fills the current gap for easier searching and discoverability of Swift Packages.
